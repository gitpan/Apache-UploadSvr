This distribution contains the code that I desribed in my talk about

  Seamless Publishing on the Web

on the O'Reilly Perl Conference, 2.0, on August 20th, 1998. The slides
of the talk are in the directory perl-conf-1998.

Code is not polished and catastrophically underdocumented, but several
people at the conference have expressed urgent desire for an upload,
so please be patient if you can't use it, look into the code or wait
until I come around to write some docu.

If you are clueful enough to understand the code, please consider
taking over the whole module/application. It's mainly a proof of
concept implementation and it works fine for us. So I probably won't
be able to support it as much as I would like.

Enjoy,
andreas koenig
